                            PYTHON USER INPUT
Python allows for user input
That means that we are able to ask user for an input
the method is bit different in python 3.6 than python 2.7
Python 3.6 uses the input() method
Python 2.7 use the raw input() method

The following asks for a username, and when you entered the username,
it get printed on the screen

username = input('Enter a username')
print('Username is: '+ username )

NOTE: Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function,
and continues when the user has given some input
