                                PYTHON OPERATORS
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values
print(10 + 5)

Python divides the operators in the following groups
Arithmetic operators

Assignment operators

Comparison operations

Logical operators

Identity operations

Membership operators

Bitwise operators

                        PYTHON ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations

OPERATOR            NAME                        EXAMPLE
+                   Addition                   x + y

-                   Subtraction                 x - y

*                   Multiplication              x * y

/                   Division                    x / y

%                   Modulus                     x % y 

**                  Exponentiation               x ** y

//                  Floor Division              x // y



                        PYTHON ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

OPERATOR                    EXAMPLE                        SAME AS
=                           x = 5                          x = 5

+=                          x += 3                         x = x+ 3

-=                          x -= 3                         x = x- 3

*=                          x *= 3                         x = x* 3

/=                          x /= 3                         x = x/ 3


%=                          x %= 3                         x = x% 3


//=                         x //= 3                        x = x// 3

**=                         x **= 3                        x = x** 3

&=                          x &= 3                         x = x& 3

|=                          x |= 3                         x = x| 3

^=                          x ^= 3                         x = x^ 3

>>=                         x >>= 3                        x = x>> 3

<<=                         x <<= 3                        x = x<< 3



                        PYTHON COMPARISON OPERATORS
Comparison operators are uses to compare two values

OPERATOR            NAME                                EXAMPLE
==                  Equal                               x == y

!=                  Not Equal                           x != y


>                   Greater Than                        x > y

<                   Less Than                           x < y

>=                  Greater Than or Equal to            x >= y

<=                  Less Than or Equal to               x <= y


                        PYTHON LOGICAL OPERATORS
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statement

OPERATOR        DESCRIPTION                        EXAMPLE
and             Returns True if both statement     x < y and x < 10
                are true

or              Returns True if one of
                thestatement is true                x < y or y > 15

not             Reverse the result, returns
                False if the result is true


                        PYTHON IDENTITY OPERATORS
Identity operators are used to compare the object, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location

OPERATOR        DESCRIPTION                        EXAMPLE
is              Returns True if both variables
                are the same object                 x is y

is not          Returns True if both variables
                are not the same object


                        PYTHON MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object

OPERATOR                            DESCRIPTION                      
in                                  Returns True if a sequence with 
                                    the specified value is present in 
                                    the object

not in                              Returns True if a sequence with
                                    the specified value is not present
                                    in the object


                    PYTHON BITWISE OPERATORS
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers

OPERATOR        NAME                DESCRIPTION
&               AND                 Sets each bit 1 if  both bits are 1

|               OR                  Sets bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1

^               XOR                 Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1

~               NOT                 Inverts all the bits

<<              Zero fill left      Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and
                shift               let the leftmost bits fall off

>>              Signed right        Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit
                shift               in from the left, and let the rightmost bit
                                    fall off
