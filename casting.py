                                    PYTHON CASTING
There may be times when you want to specify a type on a variable
This can be done with casting 
Python is an object-Oriented-Language ,and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions


                                INT()
INT()- Constructs an integer number from an integer literal (by rounding down to the previous number) or a string literal (providing the string represent a whole number)


                                FLOAT()
FLOAT()- constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal ( providing the string represents a float or an integer)


                                STR()
STR()- constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals


INTEGER:
x = int(1)      # x will be 1
y = int(2.8)    # y will be 2
z = int('3')    # z will be 3

FLOAT:
x = float(1)    # x will be  1.0
y = float(2.8)  # y will be 2.8
z = float('3')  # z will be 3.0

STRING:
x = str('s1')  # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)     # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)   # z will be '3.0'
