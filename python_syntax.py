                        PYTHON SYNTAX
Execute Python Syntax
Python syntax can be executed by writting directly in the command line
>>>print('Hello, Python Programmers')
The result will be (Hello, Python Programmers)
or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py extension, and running it in the command line
"C:\\Users\Your Name>myfile.py"

                    PYTHON INDENTATION
                    '.'
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line
Where in other Programming languages the indentation is for readability only, The indentation in python is very important
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code 
if 5 > 2:
    print('Five is greater than two')
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation
if 5 > 2:
print('Five is greater than two')
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer,but it has to be at least one

You have to use the same number of spaces inthe same block of code
Otherwise python will give you an error
if 5 > 2:
    print('Five is greater than two')
        print('Five is greater than two')
    

                    PYTHON VARIABLES
In Python variables are created when you assign a value to it
x = 5
y = 'Hello World'

                         PYTHON COMMENT
Python has a commenting capability for the purpose of in code documentation..
Comment start with a #, and python will render the rest of the line as a comment 
# This is comment
print('Hello World')
